Business,process,modeling,,in,systems,engineering,and,software,engineering,is,the,activity,of,representing,processes,,of,an,enterprise,so,that,the,current,process,may,be,analyzed,and,improved
BPM,is,typically,performed,by,business,analysts,and,managers,who,are,seeking,to,improve,process,efficiency,and,quality,
The,process,improvements,identified,by,BPM,may,or,may,not,require,Information,Technology,involvement,
Although,that,is,a,common,driver,for,the,need,to,model,a,business,process,by,creating,a,process,master
Change,management,programs,are,typically,involved,to,put,the,improved,business,processes,into,practice
With,advances,in,technology,from,large,platform,vendors,the,vision,of,BPM,models,becoming,fully,executable,and,capable,of,simulations,and,round-trip,engineering,is,coming,closer,to,reality,every,day
Business,process,modeling,plays,an,important,role,in,the,business,process,management,,BPM,discipline
Since,both,business,process,modeling,and,business,process,management,share,the,same,abbreviation,BPM,these,activities,are,sometimes,confused,with,each,other
BPM,addresses,the,process,aspects,of,a,business,architecture,leading,to,an,all,encompassing,enterprise,architecture,
The,relationships,of,business,processes,in,the,context,of,the,rest,of,the,enterprise,systems,data,architecture,organizational,structure,strategies,etc,create,greater,capabilities,when,analyzing,and,planning,enterprise,changes,
For,example,during,a,corporate,merger,it,is,important,to,understand,the,processes,of,both,companies,in,detail,so,that,management,can,correctly,and,efficiently,identify,and,eliminate,redundancies,in,operations
The,graphical,representation,of,business,process,information,has,proven,effective,for,presenting,it,to,business,stakeholders,including,business,analysts,and,system,developers,
Visual,modeling,languages,used,to,represent,business,processes,include,Business,Process,Modeling,Notation,and,the,Unified,Modeling,Language,
Business,process,modeling,has,always,been,a,key,aspect,of,business,process,reengineering,BPR,and,continuous,improvement,approaches,such,as,Six,Sigma,For,routine,business,activities,BPM,tools,such,as,Provision,Intalio,K2,blackpearl,Axway,Lombardi,Holosofx,Holocentric,Modeler,and,TIBCO,are,used,in,order,to,represent,a,business,process,to,run,a,simulation,of,the,process,and,for,communication,purposes,For,innovative,adaptive,collaborative,human,work,the,techniques,of,human,interaction,management,are,required
Techniques,to,model,business,process,such,as,the,flow,chart,functional,flow,block,diagram,control,flow,diagram,Gantt,chart,PERT,diagram,and,IDEF,have,emerged,since,the,beginning,of,the,20th,century
The,Gantt,chart,were,among,the,first,to,arrive,around,1900,the,flow,charts,in,the,1920s,
Functional,Flow,Block,Diagram,and,PERT,in,the,1950s,Data,Flow,Diagrams,and,IDEF,in,the,1970s
Among,the,modern,methods,are,Unified,Modeling,Language,and,Business,Process,Modeling,Notation
Still,these,represent,just,a,fraction,of,the,methodologies,used,over,the,years,to,document,business,processes
The,term,business,process,modeling,itself,was,coined,in,the,1960s,in,the,field,of,systems,engineering,by,S,Williams,in,his,1967,article,Business,Process,Modeling,Improves,Administrative,Control4
His,idea,was,that,techniques,for,obtaining,a,better,understanding,of,physical,control,systems,could,be,used,in,a,similar,way,for,business,processes
It,took,until,the,1990s,before,the,term,became,popular
In,the,1990s,the,term,process,became,a,new,productivity,paradigm
Companies,were,encouraged,to,think,in,processes,instead,of,functions,and,procedures
Process,thinking,looks,at,the,chain,of,events,in,the,company,from,purchase,to,supply,from,order,retrieval,to,sales,etc,
The,traditional,modeling,tools,were,developed,to,picture,time,and,costs,while,modern,methods,focus,on,cross-function,activities,
These,cross-functional,activities,have,increased,severely,in,number,and,importance,due,to,the,growth,of,complexity,and,dependencies
New,methodologies,such,as,business,process,redesign,business,process,innovation,business,process,management,integrated,business,planning,among,others,all,aiming,at,improving,processes,across,the,traditional,functions,that,comprise,a,company
In,the,field,of,software,engineering,the,term,business,process,modeling,opposed,the,common,software,process,modeling,
aiming,to,focus,more,on,the,state,of,the,practice,during,software,development
In,that,time,early,1990s,all,existing,and,new,modeling,techniques,to,picture,business,processes,were,considered,and,called,business,process,modeling,languages,In,the,Object,Oriented,approach,it,was,considered,to,be,an,essential,step,in,the,specification,of,Business,Application,Systems,
Business,process,modeling,became,the,base,of,new,methodologies,that,for,example,also,supported,data,collection,
Around,1995,the,first,visually,oriented,tools,for,business,process,modeling,and,implementation,were,being,presented
Business,model,design,template:,Nine,building,blocks,and,their,relationships,
A,business,model,is,a,framework,for,creating,economic,social,and/or,other,forms,of,value
The,term,'business,model',is,thus,used,for,a,broad,range,of,informal,and,formal,descriptions,to,represent,core,aspects,of,a,business,including,purpose,offerings,strategies,infrastructure,
organizational,structures,trading,practices,and,operational,processes,and,policies
In,the,most,basic,sense,a,business,model,is,the,method,of,doing,business,by,which,a,company,can,sustain,itself
That,is,generate,revenue
The,business,model,spells-out,how,a,company,makes,money,by,specifying,where,it,is,positioned,in,the,value,chain
A,business,process,is,a,collection,of,related,
structured,activities,or,tasks,that,produce,a,specific,service,or,product,serve,a,particular,goal,for,a,particular,customer,or,customers
There,are,three,main,types,of,business,processes
,Management,processes,the,processes,that,govern,the,operation,of,a,system
,Typical,management,processes,include,Corporate,Governance,and,Strategic,Management
Operational,processes,processes,that,constitute,the,core,business,and,create,the,primary,value,stream,Typical,operational,processes,are,Purchasing,Manufacturing,Marketing,and,Sales
Supporting,processes,which,support,the,core,processes,Examples,include,Accounting,Recruitment,Technical,support

A,business,process,can,be,decomposed,into,several,sub-processes,which,have,their,own,attributes,but,also,contribute,to,achieving,the,goal,of,the,super-process
The,analysis,of,business,processes,typically,includes,the,mapping,of,processes,and,sub-processes,down,to,activity,level
A,business,process,model,is,a,model,of,one,or,more,business,processes,and,defines,the,ways,in,which,operations,are,carried,out,to,accomplish,the,intended,objectives,of,an,organization
Such,a,model,remains,an,abstraction,and,depends,on,the,intended,use,of,the,model,
It,can,describe,the,workflow,or,the,integration,between,business,processes,It,can,be,constructed,in,multiple,levels

A,workflow,is,a,depiction,of,a,sequence,of,operations,declared,as,work,of,a,person,work,of,a,simple,or,complex,mechanism,work,of,a,group,of,persons,work,of,an,organization,of,staff,or,machines,
Workflow,may,be,seen,as,any,abstraction,of,real,work,segregated,in,workshare,work,split,or,whatever,types,of,ordering,
For,control,purposes,workflow,may,be,a,view,on,real,work,under,a,chosen,aspect

Business,process,modeling,tools,provide,business,users,with,the,ability,to,model,their,business,processes,implement,and,execute,those,models,and,refine,the,models,based,on,as-executed,data,
As,a,result,business,process,modeling,tools,can,provide,transparency,into,business,processes,as,well,as,the,centralization,of,corporate,business,process,models,and,execution,metrics
